Overview:
Kernel
- This is the main iPodLinux kernel.
- ZeroSlackr uses a modified kernel that allows for
  the loop-mount installation method and is compatible
  with newer iBoy builds.
- It can also load a normal, partitioned iPodLinux
  installation (see the "loader.cfg" file).
- The SansaLinux port uses a pre-compiled 2.4.24 kernel
  which operates slightly differently from the iPod's
  2.4.32 kernel. I will integrate the port into the
  official SVN and try to upgrade to 2.4.32 later.
For more information, see:

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)

Usage:
- The kernel is used like any other Linux kernel.
- It can be loaded by Loader2 with kernel arguments.
- For the proper boot command lines, see "loader.cfg" and
  "/docs/kernel/kernel-parameters.txt"
